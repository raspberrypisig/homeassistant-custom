Installed mjpeg-stream on raspbian, using instructions here https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer. Only thing not mentioned is following

```sh
sudo apt install -y libgphoto2-dev
```

Once done, run

```sh
sudo mjpg_streamer -i "input_uvc.so -r VGA -f 10" -o "output_http.so -w  /storage/homeassistant/share/hassio/share"
```
